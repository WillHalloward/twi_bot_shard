## Architecture and Code Organization

### Current State
The project uses a modular architecture with cogs for feature organization, a service container for dependency injection, and a repository pattern for database access. While this provides a good foundation, there are inconsistencies in implementation and opportunities for improvement.

### Goals
- Improve code maintainability and readability
- Reduce coupling between components
- Standardize patterns across the codebase
- Make the system more testable and extensible

### Proposed Changes

1. **Complete Service Container Implementation**
   - Rationale: The current dependency injection approach is inconsistently applied, making testing difficult and creating tight coupling.
   - Actions:
     - Refactor all cogs to use the service container for dependencies
     - Create interfaces for all services to enable mock implementations
     - Implement proper lifecycle management for services
     - Document the dependency injection pattern for contributors

2. **Standardize Error Handling**
   - Rationale: Error handling is inconsistent across cogs, leading to unpredictable user experiences and difficult debugging.
   - Actions:
     - Implement a consistent error handling strategy across all cogs
     - Create a hierarchy of custom exceptions for different error types
     - Add error telemetry to track and analyze common errors
     - Ensure all user-facing errors provide helpful messages

3. **Refactor Large Cogs**
   - Rationale: Several cogs exceed 500 lines, making them difficult to maintain and understand.
   - Actions:
     - Break down large cogs into smaller, focused modules
     - Extract common functionality into utility classes
     - Maintain backward compatibility with existing commands
     - Improve test coverage for refactored components

4. **Implement Command Middleware**
   - Rationale: Cross-cutting concerns like validation, permissions, and logging are duplicated across commands.
   - Actions:
     - Create a middleware system for command processing
     - Implement middleware for common concerns (validation, permissions, logging)
     - Apply middleware consistently across all commands
     - Document the middleware system for contributors

## Performance Optimization

### Current State
The bot performs adequately for current usage, but there are opportunities to improve efficiency, especially for database operations and external API calls.

### Goals
- Reduce response time for commands
- Minimize resource usage
- Handle larger servers and higher message volumes
- Improve reliability under load

### Proposed Changes

1. **Database Query Optimization**
