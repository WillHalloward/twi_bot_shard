# Security Review Process

This document outlines the security review process for the Twi Bot Shard project. It provides guidelines, checklists, and procedures for reviewing new code for security issues.

## Overview

The security review process is designed to identify and address security vulnerabilities before they are introduced into the codebase. This process should be followed for all new features, significant changes, and especially for code that handles sensitive data or operations.

## Security Review Workflow

### 1. Pre-Review Preparation

Before submitting code for review, developers should:

- Run automated security scanning tools locally
- Complete the security self-assessment checklist
- Document any security considerations or potential risks

### 2. Automated Security Scanning

All pull requests will automatically trigger the security scanning workflow, which includes:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning using Safety
- Static code analysis using Bandit
- Secret scanning using Gitleaks

### 3. Security Review Checklist

Reviewers should evaluate the code against the following security checklist:

#### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated using the validation utilities
- [ ] Input validation is applied consistently across similar inputs
- [ ] Error messages do not reveal sensitive information

#### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Proper permission checks are implemented for all commands
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms follow security best practices
- [ ] Authorization is enforced at all appropriate levels

#### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Credentials and secrets are handled securely
- [ ] Personal data is handled in compliance with privacy regulations

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- [ ] Error logging does not include sensitive data
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms are in place for critical operations

#### Database Operations
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements to prevent injection
- [ ] Database credentials are properly secured
- [ ] Database access follows the principle of least privilege

#### API Security
- [ ] API endpoints validate and sanitize all inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for public-facing endpoints
- [ ] API responses do not leak sensitive information

#### Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Security-relevant events are properly logged
- [ ] Logs do not contain sensitive information
- [ ] Monitoring is in place for suspicious activity

### 4. Security Review Meeting

For significant changes or features that handle sensitive data, a security review meeting should be held with:

- The developer(s) who implemented the changes
- At least one security-focused reviewer
- A project maintainer or technical lead

During this meeting, the team will:
- Review the security checklist
- Discuss any identified security concerns
- Develop mitigation strategies for any risks

### 5. Post-Review Actions

After the security review:

- All identified security issues must be addressed before merging
- Security improvements should be documented
- Lessons learned should be shared with the team

## Security Self-Assessment Checklist

Developers should complete this self-assessment before submitting code for review:

1. Have you identified all inputs to your code and validated them appropriately?
2. Have you handled all error conditions securely?
3. Have you avoided hardcoding any secrets or credentials?
4. Have you used parameterized queries for all database operations?
5. Have you implemented appropriate permission checks?
6. Have you logged security-relevant events without exposing sensitive data?
7. Have you considered the security implications of any third-party libraries you've added?
8. Have you documented any security considerations or potential risks?

## Security Issue Severity Levels

Security issues should be categorized by severity to prioritize remediation:

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Exposure of sensitive user data
- Privilege escalation

### High
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Insecure direct object references
- Unvalidated redirects

### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure configuration
- Missing security headers

### Low
- Minor information disclosure
- Theoretical vulnerabilities
- Best practice violations

## Reporting Security Issues

If a security vulnerability is discovered in production:

1. Report the issue immediately to the security team
2. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly
3. Document the issue with steps to reproduce
4. Assess the severity and potential impact
5. Develop and implement a remediation plan
6. Create a post-incident report

## Continuous Improvement

The security review process should be continuously improved based on:

- Lessons learned from security reviews
- New threats and vulnerabilities
- Feedback from team members
- Results from security testing and audits

This document should be reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure it remains effective and relevant.
