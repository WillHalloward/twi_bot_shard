### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Generic Exception Handling**: Many commands use bare `except:` or `except Exception:` without specific error types
2. **Poor Logging**: Many commands use `print()` statements or `logging.exception()` without context
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Several commands have no error handling at all
4. **Security Risks**: Some commands (like `cmd`, `sql_query`, `say`) need better validation
5. **Inconsistent Feedback**: User feedback varies greatly in quality across commands
6. **External API Handling**: Commands calling external APIs often lack proper error handling

### Recommendations:
1. Implement specific exception handling for different error types
2. Add structured logging with proper context
3. Improve user feedback messages with actionable information
4. Add input validation and sanitization for security-sensitive commands
5. Implement retry logic for external API calls
6. Add comprehensive documentation for all commands
