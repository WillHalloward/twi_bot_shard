"""
Refactored Stats Cog for Discord Bot.

This module provides comprehensive statistics tracking and reporting functionality
for Discord servers. It has been refactored from a monolithic 2639-line file into
smaller, focused modules for better maintainability.

The cog tracks:
- Message statistics and history
- User activity and membership changes
- Reaction data
- Channel and server information
- Voice activity
- And much more...

Architecture:
- StatsCommandsMixin: Owner commands for data management
- StatsListenersMixin: Real-time event listeners
- StatsTasksMixin: Background tasks for reporting
- StatsQueriesMixin: User-facing query commands
- StatsUtils: Utility functions for data processing
