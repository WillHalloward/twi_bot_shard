## Issues Addressed During Previous Sessions

### Fixed Import Issues
- **Issue**: Incorrect import paths in test files for mocking external functions
- **Resolution**: Updated import paths in `tests/test_end_to_end.py` and `tests/test_regression.py`
  - Changed `patch("cogs.twi.fetch", ...)` to `patch("cogs.patreon_poll.fetch", ...)`
  - Added proper permission mocking for bot channel checks

### Fixed Permission Check Issues
- **Issue**: Missing permission checks in test scenarios
- **Resolution**: Added proper mocking for `utils.permissions.is_bot_channel` function calls

### Fixed Configuration Access Issues
- **Issue**: Configuration module access in different contexts
- **Resolution**: Added proper patching for both `config.password_allowed_channel_ids` and `cogs.twi.config.password_allowed_channel_ids`
