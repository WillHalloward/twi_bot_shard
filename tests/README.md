## Running All Tests

To run all tests in sequence, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m tests.test_dependencies && python -m tests.test_db_connection && python -m tests.test_sqlalchemy_models && python -m tests.test_cogs && python -m tests.test_decorators && python -m tests.test_permissions && python -m tests.test_db_operations && python -m tests.test_end_to_end && python -m tests.test_integration && python -m tests.test_stats_cog && python -m tests.test_other_cog && python -m tests.test_interactive_help && python -m tests.test_property_based && python -m tests.test_validation_property_based && python -m tests.test_mock_example && python -m tests.test_timeout_example && python -m tests.test_chaos_engineering
```

This will run each test in sequence and stop if any test fails.

Alternatively, you can use pytest to run all tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=xml
```

This will generate a coverage report in XML format that can be used by tools like Codecov to track code coverage over time.

## Using pytest-mock and pytest-timeout

The project now includes support for pytest-mock and pytest-timeout, which provide additional testing capabilities:

### pytest-mock

pytest-mock provides a fixture called `mocker` that helps with mocking dependencies in tests. It's a thin wrapper around the unittest.mock module with some additional features:

```python
def test_example(mocker):
    # Mock a function or method
    mock_function = mocker.patch('module.function')

    # Configure the mock
    mock_function.return_value = 'mocked result'

    # Call the code that uses the mocked function
    result = some_function_that_calls_module_function()

    # Verify the mock was called correctly
    mock_function.assert_called_once_with(expected_args)
```

See `tests/test_mock_example.py` for more examples of how to use pytest-mock.

### pytest-timeout

pytest-timeout helps prevent tests from hanging indefinitely by setting timeouts:

```python
@pytest.mark.timeout(5)  # 5 seconds timeout
def test_example():
    # This test will fail if it takes longer than 5 seconds
    time.sleep(1)
    assert True
```

You can also set a global timeout for all tests by using the `--timeout` command-line option:

```bash
pytest --timeout=10  # 10 seconds timeout for all tests
```

See `tests/test_timeout_example.py` for more examples of how to use pytest-timeout.

## Using Faker with Mock Factories

The project now includes support for Faker, which provides realistic test data for mock objects. The mock factories in `tests/mock_factories.py` have been enhanced to use Faker for generating realistic data.

### Mock Factories with Faker

The following mock factories have been enhanced with Faker:

- `MockUserFactory`: Creates mock Discord users with realistic usernames, discriminators, etc.
- `MockMemberFactory`: Creates mock Discord guild members with realistic data.
- `MockGuildFactory`: Creates mock Discord guilds with realistic server names, etc.
- `MockChannelFactory`: Creates mock Discord channels with realistic channel names, topics, etc.
- `MockMessageFactory`: Creates mock Discord messages with realistic content.

### Using Enhanced Mock Factories

You can use the enhanced mock factories in your tests to create more realistic mock objects:

```python
# Create a mock user with random realistic data
user = MockUserFactory.create()

# Create a mock user with specific values (backward compatible)
custom_user = MockUserFactory.create(user_id=123456789, name="CustomUser")

# Create a mock guild with random realistic data
guild = MockGuildFactory.create()

# Create a mock channel with random realistic data
channel = MockChannelFactory.create_text_channel(guild=guild)

# Create a mock message with random realistic content
message = MockMessageFactory.create(author=user, channel=channel, guild=guild)
```

The mock factories are designed to be backward compatible, so you can still provide specific values for any parameter if needed. If you don't provide a value, Faker will generate a realistic value for you.

See the `example_usage()` function in `tests/mock_factories.py` for more examples of how to use the enhanced mock factories.
